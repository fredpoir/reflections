How did vieweing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

You can compare what it was before and after the change were made.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer 
in the long term?

You can see easily what changed over time and not have to browse all line of backed up file.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do
in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros . File aren't saved with uncompleted feature or code, not breaking the actual program.
Cons . This could lead to lost of code if not saved and proplem with the pc.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because change in file are linked by the modification made by that user or feature added.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log give you history one after the other from recent to earlier commit.
git diff give you a view of what change between two commit, even if they are close or not.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I could always come back and look at the change if something is broken.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Learn the way it work so I can use it and learn coding.
