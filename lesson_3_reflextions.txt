When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Have backup and be able to work with someone else at the same time.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To not breake what you already doing.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is like clone but directly in Github and show hoe many people use the code.
Clone is to take the code locally.
Branch is to manage new feature and new changes possible.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can compare change done.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Each one would have to build their part of the code and no user should modify the same files at the same time.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

With colaboration you should use branch to make large change and see if it's still fit with others work.
